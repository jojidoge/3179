    <h1>2019-2020 Australian Bushfires</h1>
    <p>A brief history of bushfires in Australia and a deep dive into the 2019-2020 Black Summer season.</p>

        <p>Throughout the 2010s, Australia experienced increasingly <b>severe</b> and <b>widespread</b> bushfire seasons, driven by rising temperatures and prolonged droughts. The decade saw a number of destructive fires, including the 2013 fires in New South Wales, which razed hundreds of homes. Year by year, fire activity intensified, with ecosystems, wildlife, and communities across the nation facing mounting challenges. These events foreshadowed what would become the most devastating fire season in Australia's history — <b>the Black Summer of 2019.</b> </p>

      <h2>The 2019-2020 Black Summer Bushfires</h2>
      
      <div class="grid-container">
        <div class="text-container" id="text2">
          <p>The Black Summer began between August and September 2019, marked by a significant increase in forest fires across Australia. These early fires, though not unprecedented, served as a warning sign of the conditions to come. With dry spells and high temperatures fueling the flames, the growing fire activity set the stage for what would become a challenging and intense fire season. Understanding this critical period helps illustrate how the landscape was primed for the worst summer yet.</p>
          <p>The map on the right shows satellite readings of bushfires between August and September 2019. The brightness of each reading maps directly to the fire's burn temperature in Kelvins. <b>A higher brightness indicates a higher temperature.</b> </p>

        <div class="text-container" id="text3">
          <p>As the Black Summer unfolded, fires escalated in intensity, devastating vast areas of land across Australia. Prolonged drought, record-breaking temperatures, and strong winds fueled an unprecedented fire season, igniting fierce blazes that engulfed communities and wildlife alike. The bar chart on the left highlights the burnt proportions across states, with the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) experiencing the highest at 58%. This significant figure is a result of the region's vulnerability, intensified by its flammable vegetation and challenging topography. Following closely, New South Wales (NSW) recorded a burnt proportion of 25%, reflecting its extensive bushland. In contrast, states like Northern Territory and Tasmania exhibited minimal burnt proportions.</p>
          <p>The fires raged on with no signs of stopping until March 2020, leaving severe impacts that would require a long time to address and recover from.</p>

      <h2>Impact of the Fires</h2>
      
      <div class="grid-container">
        <div class="text-container" id="text4">
          <p>The fires had a lasting impact on ecosystems, both terrestrial and aquatic. In aquatic environments, the destruction of vegetation and soil erosion introduced significant amounts of nutrients into the water, leading to changes in water quality. Increased runoff from burned areas contributed to shifts in the ecological balance, affecting the health of aquatic life. </p>
          <p>The chart below shows measurements taken from lakes before and after the fires. Overall, salinity decreased, while flourescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM), chlorophyll (C), and blue algae levels rose, with pH remaining the same. These changes suggest that nutrient levels in the water may have become elevated, potentially leading to harmful algal blooms. This indicates a decline in water quality in the affected aquatic ecosystems.</p>

        <div class="vis-container" id="vis5"></div>
        <div class="text-container" id="text5">
          <p>The impact on local wildlife was catastrophic. An estimated <b>3 billion animals</b> were affected, with significant declines in populations of protected species like the Kangaroo Island Dunnart and Pygmy Trapdoor Spider due to habitat destruction. The Victorian State Government (2020) found that some ecosystems experienced up to a 30% decline in species numbers. This crisis highlighted the fragility of Australia’s unique biodiversity, prompting urgent recovery efforts, including wildlife corridors and rehabilitation programs to protect vulnerable species and restore their habitats.</p>
           <p>The bubble chart above visually represents the percentage distributions of protected species in fire-stricken areas. Each bubble corresponds to a specific species, with its size indicating the percentage of the population affected by the fires.</p>

      <h2>The Aftermath</h2>  <!-- Added heading -->
      <div class="vis-container" id="vis4"></div>
      <div class="text-container" id="text6">
        <p>In the aftermath of the fires, various recovery projects were initiated across the east coast of Australia, aimed at restoring the affected areas and supporting local communities. The chart on the left provides a visual representation of these key recovery initiatives, with each dot representing a specific project location. Hovering over any dot reveals detailed information about each recovery project, including its objectives, funding, and progress.</p>
        <p>Australia is slowly healing from the devastation of the Black Summer bushfires, despite the ongoing challenges posed by annual fire seasons. The collective efforts of communities, conservationists, and policymakers reflect a commitment to rebuilding and restoring both ecosystems and livelihoods. While the scars of that catastrophic season remain, the resilience demonstrated by both nature and people provides hope for a more sustainable future. As recovery initiatives continue to evolve, there is a growing understanding of the importance of preparedness and adaptation in the face of climate change. </p>
